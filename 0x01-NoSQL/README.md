NoSQL,which stands for "Not Only SQL", is a type of database management system that is designed to handle and store unstructured or semi-structured data, as well as large volumes of data that may not fit well into a traditional relational database model. NoSQL databases are non-tabular, and typically use a variety of data models, including key-value, document-oriented, column-family, and graph databases.
